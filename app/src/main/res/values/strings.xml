    <string name="poem">Sunday, June 22, 1941\n
The country has woken up peacefully\n
On this June day,\n
It just opened\n
Her lilacs are in the park.\n
Rejoicing in the sun and the world,\n
Moscow greeted the morning.\n
Suddenly they spread across the airwaves\n
Memorable words...\n
the voice is confident and strict\n
The country recognized it immediately.\n
On our doorstep in the morning\n
The war broke out.\n
